# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update in-app assignment and info popup copy with the user-provided English text, and bold the specified headings within those new text blocks.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the instructional text for the 5 fixed daily assignments (Awareness, Utopia, Small Steps, Support Strategies, Other Contemplations) shown in the in-challenge assignment detail popups with the new provided English copy (full replacement).
- Adjust assignment detail popup rendering so that the “Step 1:”, “Step 2:”, and “Step 3:” labels within the new assignment text blocks are bold, while the body text remains normal weight.
- Replace the content of the two info popups (Social Contemplation and About the challenge) with the new provided English copy (full replacement), keeping the existing popup structure and bold section-heading styling.

**User-visible outcome:** Opening any assignment detail popup or the Social Contemplation / About the challenge info popups shows the updated English text, with step labels and section headings displayed in bold as specified.
