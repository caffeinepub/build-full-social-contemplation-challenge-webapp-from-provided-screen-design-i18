  "summary": "Diff adds build/version stamping utilities and diagnostics updates, plus a deployment verification checklist. However, evidence for an actual successful redeploy is not present, and build-time HTML meta stamping may still rely on placeholder substitution that cannot be confirmed from the diff alone.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Redeploy the application to the live environment and confirm the deployment completes successfully (no deployment error) and that the live app loads.",
      "reason": "The diff includes a verification checklist, but no evidence of an executed redeploy (e.g., CI/CD config, deployment logs, or any change that demonstrates a completed live deployment).",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the deployed HTML contains a non-empty meta[name=\"app-version\"] value that is not a placeholder pattern.",
      "reason": "The source HTML still contains a placeholder string (%VITE_BUILD_TIMESTAMP%) in the meta tag. While runtime fallback stamping is added, the requirement explicitly calls for the deployed HTML meta content to be non-empty/non-placeholder; build-time substitution is implied but not provable from this diff summary alone.",
