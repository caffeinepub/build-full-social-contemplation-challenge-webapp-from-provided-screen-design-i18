  "summary": "Diff adds an AssignmentDetailText component to bold “Step X:” labels and updates FIXED_ASSIGNMENTS copy for several assignments. However, evidence for updating the two info popups and for fully updating all 5 assignment texts (and wiring the bold rendering into the actual popup) is incomplete or missing in the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "The diff shows updated content for Awareness, Utopia, Small Steps, and Support Strategies, but the `other-contemplations` assignment content is truncated and not shown, so full replacement for all 5 assignments cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "A new component exists to render bold step labels, and Screen6 imports it, but the diff excerpt does not show it being used in the assignment detail popup rendering (i.e., replacement of the prior rendering in the popup body). Therefore, the required UI behavior in the actual popup cannot be confirmed from the provided summary.",

      "requirement": "Replace the content of the two info popups (Social Contemplation and About the challenge) with the exact new English copy provided by the user, keeping the existing popup structure and bold section headings.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows the Social Contemplation/About popups’ sectioned copy being replaced with the user-provided text. The modified `translations.ts` excerpt shown does not include the info popup content/sections, and `InfoPopups.tsx` is only mentioned in a separate file summary (not a diff).",
