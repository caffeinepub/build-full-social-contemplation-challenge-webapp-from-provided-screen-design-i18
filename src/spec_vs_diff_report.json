  "summary": "Diff shows changes primarily to the in-app AudioRecorder UI, adding/adjusting recording/review/save states. However, based on the provided diff summary, there is insufficient evidence that all file-upload UI elements across the app were removed, and the recorder’s full start/stop/review/save flow (including absence of any \"Upload\" label) cannot be fully verified due to truncation. Additionally, project metadata files were modified with items beyond this step’s scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove (hide/disable) all UI elements that allow users to upload an existing audio file anywhere in the app (no file-input based audio upload control visible; users cannot select a local audio file).",
      "reason": "The diff summary only shows changes to `AudioRecorder.tsx` and does not show removal of any `<input type=\"file\">` (or similar file picker) controls elsewhere in the app. With the limited evidence provided, global removal of file-upload UI cannot be confirmed.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the in-app audio recorder flow is active and usable (start, stop, review playback, proceed with save/share) and no user-facing control labeled \"Upload\" is shown.",
      "reason": "`AudioRecorder.tsx` shows stop/review/save-related UI, but the file is truncated before the primary save button label is fully visible, and the start-recording UI is not shown in the excerpt. Therefore, the full end-to-end recorder flow and the explicit absence of any \"Upload\" label cannot be conclusively verified from the provided diff summary.",
