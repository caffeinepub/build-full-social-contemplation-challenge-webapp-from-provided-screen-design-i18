  "summary": "Implemented a build-version generation script and runtime logic to stamp a generated BUILD_VERSION into the `meta[name=\"app-version\"]` tag, but the diff does not show any change ensuring the HTML meta tag is updated at build time as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The generated build has a different app version identifier than the previous build (the HTML meta tag `app-version` is updated at build time).",
      "reason": "While a build-time script generates a version and writes it to `.env.local` and a generated TS module, the diff does not include any change to the HTML template (e.g., `index.html`) to set/update the `meta[name=\"app-version\"]` content at build time. The only shown mechanism is runtime stamping via `stampBuildVersion` on app startup.",
