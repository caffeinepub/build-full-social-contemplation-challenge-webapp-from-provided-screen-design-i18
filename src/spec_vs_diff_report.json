  "summary": "Diff removes waveform usage from AudioRecorder and implements a live RMS-based level meter update loop via Web Audio AnalyserNode with requestAnimationFrame, including AudioContext resume for Safari/iOS. However, it also introduces an unrequested `isPaused` recording state and updates project_state.json with new feature request entries that were not part of the BuildRequest.",
